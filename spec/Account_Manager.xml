        <tt>/com/meego/xpmn/ytstenut/AccountManager</tt>.</p>

      <p>This account manager interface is used to discover the
        ytstenut account.  This account is created automatically and
        is always present.  Callers can use the
        <tp:member-ref>Hold</tp:member-ref> and
        <tp:member-ref>Release</tp:member-ref> methods to indicate
        their usage of the account. If at least one caller has
        indicated their usage of the account then the accounts
        presence will be set to available.</p>
